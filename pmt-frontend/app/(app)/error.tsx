/**
 * The dashboard's error boundary.
 *
 * Until this file existed there was NONE - not here, not at the root - so any
 * unhandled error anywhere in the dashboard fell through to Next's built-in
 * screen: "This page couldn't load. Reload to try again, or go back." on an
 * otherwise blank page, with the sidebar gone and no clue what failed.
 *
 * Someone hit it mid-task and reported the screen as broken. The compounding
 * part was the advice:
 * "Reload" re-requests the CURRENT url, and several dashboard routes are bare
 * (`/trips/{id}` redirects without a `?step=`), so reloading did not return
 * them to where they were - it dropped them somewhere else entirely and looked
 * like the app had thrown their work away.
 *
 * Being a segment boundary rather than a root one, this keeps the shell: the
 * sidebar, search and account menu stay usable, so a failed page is one broken
 * page instead of a broken product. `reset()` re-renders the segment without a
 * full document load, which recovers a transient failure (an expired token
 * refreshed in the background, a backend blip) with the client cache intact.
 *
 * The digest is shown deliberately. It is the only handle support has on a
 * server-side error - the message itself is redacted in production - and an
 * person who can read it out is worth more than a tidier screen.
