/**
 * Re-sync an RHF form to server-derived values when the source record (`key`)
 * changes — a refetch — but ONLY while the form is pristine.
 *
 * The forms in the tour wizard used to call `reset(toDefaults(trip))` in a
 * `[trip]` effect unconditionally. Because the app refetches on window-focus
 * (30s stale) and sibling child-collection saves invalidate the trip detail,
 * that effect fired while someone had unsaved edits in a sibling core-field
 * form and `reset()` wiped them — and, worse, flipped `isDirty` back to false so
 * the "unsaved changes" guard went silent and Continue advanced "clean".
 * (code-review C1/H1.)
 *
 * Guarding on `!isDirty` keeps every existing behaviour:
 * - first load / edit-mode population: form is pristine → reset runs (unchanged);
 * - after their own save resets the form: pristine, so the next refetch
 *   re-syncs to the saved server value (unchanged);
 * - only new case: a refetch that arrives while the form is dirty is ignored,
 *   so in-progress input survives.
 *
 * THE SECOND BULLET IS A CONTRACT, NOT AN OBSERVATION. Every caller must call
 * `reset(values)` itself on a successful save. Without that the form is still
 * dirty when the post-save refetch lands, this hook correctly declines to
 * clobber it, and the step is stuck reading "Unsaved changes" over work that is
 * already on the server - which is exactly what it did on every step until
 * 2026-08-06. A caller that saves and never resets is a bug in the caller.
 *
 * Keyed on `key` alone (like the original `[trip]`); the dirty flag is read at
 * run time, never a dependency — depending on it would re-run reset on the
 * post-save `true→false` transition with a possibly-stale record.
